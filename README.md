# Pulizia Strade Cagliari Lite

Lite version of Pulizia Strade Cagliari. It is written using React-Native (and other technologies from [Facebook OpenSource](https://opensource.facebook.com)).
It works similar to Street Cleaning Cagliari, but for use this version it is not needed to subscribe theirs cars. 
The only thing that the user has to do is the subscription to one (or many) street (s). The UI is extrimely simple in such a way that it can be used easily by everyone.
It will be available for both Android and iOS.
